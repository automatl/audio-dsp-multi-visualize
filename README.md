SPTool
=========================

Sound Perception Tool is a small and lightweight audio visualization instrument, which currently provides spectrometer and goniometer. The main advantage of this tool is that it can view information about up to four stereo pairs at the same time using different colors (see screenshots). And more cool features are on the way, that's for sure.

As SPTool based on cross-platform [JUCE library](http://www.juce.com) it can be built in many different flavors. Native [VST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) builds are known to work in both Linux and Windows for example.
